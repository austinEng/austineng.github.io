excerpt: Fancy GUI widgets for my computer graphics project
title: Starting CIS 560
---

<p>CIS 560 has been a pretty awesome class so far. Right now, a bunch of the stuff is review from my <a href="/code/Mini-Maya/">CIS 277 Mini Maya project</a> so I've had a lot of time to work on some extra features. This has come mainly in the form of creating more useful widgets in the GUI to make interacting with the program easier.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-12">
    <a href="/img/560/cis560-gui.png"><img src="/img/560/cis560-gui.png"/></a>
    <div class="caption">Multiple, Detachable, Dockable, GL windows; Auto-generated settings widgets</div>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Additional GL Windows</h2>
<p>At first, I thought that accomplishing this would be fairly easy. I just needed to programmatically spawn extra <code>QOpenGLWidgets</code>, but this approach was rather short-sighted. The first hurdle was managing OpenGL contexts. It turns out you need to set <code>QApplication::setAttribute(Qt::AA_ShareOpenGLContexts);</code> for Qt to automatically share graphics contexts between the widgets. Beyond that, it's important to make sure that your vertex attribute buffers are being managed properly. Namely, if you have multiple GL windows, you need to make sure that <code>makeCurrent()</code> is called before destroying, creating, or binding vertex array objects.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I ran into a horridly annoying problem when putting a <code>QOpenGLWidget</code> in a <code>QDockWidget</code>. Everything worked fine if they were just in normal widgets, but for some reason, the <code>QDockWidget</code> caused the program to abruptly crash. According to <a href="http://www.qtcentre.org/threads/61312-Issue-placing-a-QOpenGLWidget-in-a-QDockWidget">this</a> forum, certain events with the <code>QDockWidget</code> end up corrupting <code>QOpenGLFunctions</code> which <code>QOpenGLWidget</code> inherits from. The workaround is to instead include <code>QOpenGLFunctions</code> as a member variable and then use that to call OpenGL functions. Here's the solution I found:</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;QOpenGLWidget&gt;
#include &lt;QOpenGLFunctions_4_3_Core&gt;
 
class OpenGLWidget : public QOpenGLWidget{
public:
	explicit OpenGLWidget(QWidget * pParent = nullptr) : QOpenGLWidget(pParent) {setFixedSize(200, 200);}
	~OpenGLWidget() {DeleteFunctions();}
 
protected:
	void DeleteFunctions() {delete(m_pFunctions); m_pFunctions = nullptr;}
 
	virtual void initializeGL() Q_DECL_OVERRIDE{
		connect(context(), &QOpenGLContext::aboutToBeDestroyed, this, &OpenGLWidget::DeleteFunctions);
 
		m_pFunctions = new QOpenGLFunctions_4_3_Core();
		if(!m_pFunctions->initializeOpenGLFunctions()) qFatal("Failed to initialize the OpenGL functions.");
		glClearColor(0, 0, 0, 1);
	}
 
	QOpenGLFunctions_4_3_Core * m_pFunctions = nullptr;
};
</pre>

<h2>Automatically Generated Settings Widgets</h2>
<p>While working on the homeworks, I found that it was really annoying to test my code. Every time I wanted to change sampling methods or change the resolution or level of antialiasing, I would have to close the program, change some number in my code, and then rebuild and run the project. I didn't want to deal with manually creating widgets because creating them in Qt Designer and connecting all the signals and slots is incredibly tedious. Writing the code to connect them is likewise unecessarily tedious.</p>
<p>So, I sought out to spend some extra time developing a way to handle the automatic creation of widgets to update various settings in the program. Here's a summary of how everything works:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Any object that I want to be editable with a widget contains a <code>Settings</code> object. <code>Settings</code> contains functions such as <code>addIntegerField</code>, <code>addPointerListField</code>, <code>addEnumListField</code>, <code>addFloatDisplayField</code>, <code>addBoolField</code>, etc.</li>
	<li>Each of these creation <code>add________Field</code> functions takes in a reference to the desired field to be modified, along with some other parameters. For value fields, this will be min/max information. For lists, this will be source list information, for enums, a special enum class I created. All of these return a pointer to an object that inherits from <code>SettingsField</code>.</li>
	<li>Each <code>SettingsField</code> implements functions to store a value, revert to a previously stored value, create a widget, and populate widget fields.</li>
	<li><code>Settings</code> also has a <code>createWidget</code> function which creates widgets out of each of its member <code>SettingsWidgets</code> and wraps them in a window with OK, Save, and Cancel buttons.</li>
	<li><code>Settings</code> also contains an <code>onUpdateCallback</code> function which can be set and is called when the settings are saved. This allows us to automatically update the GL window or rebuild spatial acceleration structures like BVH's when we change settings.</li>
	<li>Static fields can also be created and set when the widget is changed or populated. This allows for display and calculation of BVH tree statistics within the widget.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Test Renders</h2>
I suppose this post wouldn't be complete with actual images of renders from the first few homeworks, so here they are:
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-12">
    <a href="/img/560/many_spheres_4x4_Stratified_accel_60096ms.bmp"><img src="/img/560/many_spheres_4x4_Stratified_accel_60096ms.bmp"/></a>
    <div class="caption">Stratified sampling, 16 spp, rendered in 1 minute</div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
    <a href="/img/560/wahoo_4x4_Stratified_accel_96225ms.bmp"><img src="/img/560/wahoo_4x4_Stratified_accel_96225ms.bmp"/></a>
    <div class="caption">Stratified sampling, 16 spp, 5178 polygons, rendered in 1.5 minutes</div>
  </div>
