excerpt: My first blog post, powered by Jekyll
---

<p>Here begins the new design for my website and my attempts to start blogging about my projects. I'm not sure of the level of dedication that will ultimately go into updating this, but hopefully it will be able to serve as a good record of the work that I've done. Currently I'm a rising sophomore studying Digital Media Design at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>This site is being hosted on Github Pages with Jekyll. So far, Jekyll has been easy to work with, but I'm finding it rather annoying to manage both the projects page and the blog page since Jekyll really only supports a single blog. You can get away with most of the dual-blog functionality by using separate categories, but you can't have separate default permalink styles as of now. My projects are formatted /:categories/:title and my blog posts appear to be formatted /:categories/:year/:month/:day/:title but to achieve this I'm giving the post "categories: blog 2015 5 24". Hopefully this will improve in the future, but so far it seems to work well.</p>
<p>Jekyll also doesn't support pagination with categories so that's definitely a problem that I'm going to need to figure out should I make a significant number of posts. I don't know whether or not I'll end up maintaining this blog, but hopefully I do!</p>
