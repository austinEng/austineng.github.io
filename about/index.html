    <h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>
    <p>Austin is currently a rising sophomore studying <a href="//cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd_program.html">Digital Media Design</a> at the University of Pennsylvania and is submatriculating into the Computer Graphics and Game Technology Masters Program.</p>
    <p>From a young age, Austin was always interested in animation and film. He would spend hours on end drawing in sketchbooks with his cousin, moving on to create films and stopmotion animations by the time he was in elementary school. The projects grew bigger and bigger, and before he even entered high school, Austin found himself designing and building his own camera rigs. Also interested in engineering, his house quickly became cluttered with camera cranes, dolly tracks, camera stabilizers, and all sorts of gadgets and devices. He went on to attend <a href="//www.hths.mcvsd.org/">High Technology High School</a>, a pre-engineering academy frequently ranked as the #1 STEM high school in the United States. There, he became president of the robotics club but also found himself deeply interested in computer science. Austin frequently attended college hackathons with his friends, gaining experience building and developing apps. Austin still continued to make films with his friends and cousin, focusing more on visual effects and 3D graphics. With interests in both computer science and film, Austin decided to study Digital Media Design at the University of Pennsylvania and hopes to delve more into computer graphics.</p>
